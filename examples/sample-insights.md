## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The team wants a faster vendor onboarding workflow with clearer intake requirements and approval visibility. Today the process relies on email and spreadsheets, which creates delays and missing data. A structured intake form with routing and reporting would address the biggest bottlenecks.

## PAIN POINTS
- Manual intake via email leads to missing information and rework.
- Weekly finance review creates multi-day delays.
- No clear approval trail for accountability.

## DECISION CRITERIA
- Vendor onboarding within five business days.
- Required fields enforced at intake.
- Approval routing with an auditable trail.
- Exportable reporting by department.

## KEY QUOTES
- "We don't have a standard form, so procurement asks for more details after the initial request."
- "We want vendors live in under five business days."

## FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
- Who owns the approval routing rules today?
- What systems should the intake form integrate with?
- Which departments need separate reporting views?

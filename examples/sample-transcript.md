# Transcript: sample-customer-interview

Interviewer: Thanks for joining. Can you start by describing your current workflow for onboarding new vendors?

Participant: Sure. We receive a request in email, then someone enters it into a spreadsheet, then finance reviews it weekly. It can take up to two weeks.

Interviewer: What slows it down the most?

Participant: The back-and-forth for missing information. We don't have a standard form, so procurement asks for more details after the initial request.

Interviewer: How do you measure success for this process?

Participant: Fewer delays and fewer surprises. We want vendors live in under five business days, and we want to know who approved what.

Interviewer: If you could change one thing immediately, what would it be?

Participant: A single intake form with required fields and automatic routing to the right approver.

Interviewer: Got it. Anything else we should know?

Participant: Reporting. We need to export vendor status by department for quarterly reviews.

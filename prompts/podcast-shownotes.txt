Format output with the exact headings below:
## EPISODE SUMMARY
## TOPICS COVERED
## KEY MOMENTS (TIMESTAMPS)
## QUOTABLE LINES
## RECOMMENDED LINKS (FROM TRANSCRIPT)

Guidelines:
- Keep the summary under 120 words.
- Use timestamps if present; otherwise write "Not provided."
- Only include links or resources explicitly mentioned.

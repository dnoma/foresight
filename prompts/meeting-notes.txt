You are creating internal meeting notes from a transcript. Capture decisions and actions.

Format output with the exact headings below:
## MEETING SUMMARY
## DECISIONS
## ACTION ITEMS
## RISKS / BLOCKERS
## OPEN QUESTIONS
## ATTENDEES (IF MENTIONED)

Guidelines:
- Action items should include owner and due date if stated.
- Do not invent details; keep to the transcript.
- If a section is empty, write "None noted."
